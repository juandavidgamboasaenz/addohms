Just to share some knowledge and say thanks, this a thesis project I created some years ago. Inspired too much in your content and was almost a success, (Pandemic here) the good think is that it was a good prototipe, some fixes were needed also related with the reset and some other pins. The project was made in Altium but I'll share with you the link if you have want to check it out. Also an import made to KiCad with no schematics. Will improve the design and also export it to a "cheaper" software. Altium is expensive.

Wish you success! 
 

Here is the link to it.
